| Criteria                      | Strategy Design Pattern                   | Database Migration (Flyway)        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Definition                    | 游릴 The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it. | 游릴 Database Migration is the process of managing incremental, version-controlled changes to a database schema. Tools like Flyway allow these changes to be applied in a controlled and predictable way. |
| Scalability and Maintainability | 游린 High complexity with growth. Redeployment required for new signals. | 游릴 Scripts can be added or updated at runtime without redeployment. |
| Flexibility                   | 游린 Limited. Code changes and redeployment required for changes. | 游릴 High. Scripts can be dynamically updated at runtime. |
| Security                      | 游릴 Code is statically typed and checked at compile time. | 游릵 Medium. Scripts are version-controlled, but running dynamically loaded scripts can have security implications if not properly managed. |
| Testing                       | 游릴 Straightforward to write unit tests for classes implementing specific interface. | 游릴 Changes can be tested against a copy of the production database before they're applied. |


``` bash 
    With up to 50 new signals being added each month, 
    resulting in a total of 600 in a year, 
    and an increase to 600 signals per month after a year, 
    resulting in a total of 7200 signals in the following year, 
    the Database Migration (scriptable approach) would be a more suitable solution as the 
    numbers continue to grow thereafter.
